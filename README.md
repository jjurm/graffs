*Framework for empirical analysis of graph metric robustness.*

Using experimental evaluation of various graph metrics on input graphs, this tool estimates *robustness* of graph metrics.

This project is done as part of the Part II Project of the Computer Science Tripos at the **University of Cambridge**, supervised by [Dr Timothy Griffin](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tgg22/).
