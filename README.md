# graffs

**Framework for empirical analysis of graph metric robustness.**

Using experimental evaluation of various graph metrics on input graphs, this tool tries to estimate a *robustness* of graph metrics.

This project is done as part of the Part II Project of the Computer Science Tripos at the **University of Cambridge**.
